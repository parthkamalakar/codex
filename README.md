## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1 — Just open the file
```bash
# Download or clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codex.git
cd codex

# Serve it locally (required for AI Tutor)
npx serve .
# Then open http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 2 — VS Code Live Server
1. Open `index.html` in VS Code
2. Click **"Go Live"** in the bottom right corner
3. Opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`

> ⚠️ **Do not open `index.html` by double-clicking it.** The AI Tutor makes API calls that browsers block from `file://` URLs. Always use a local server.

---

## 🔑 API Key Setup

Codex uses the **Anthropic Claude API** for the AI Tutor. You need your own API key.

**Step 1** — Get a free key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

**Step 2** — Open Codex in your browser

**Step 3** — Go to **Profile → ⚙️ Settings** → paste your key → Save

Your key is stored in your browser's `localStorage` only — it never leaves your device and is never sent to any server other than Anthropic's API directly.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
codex/
├── index.html          # The entire app — single file, no dependencies
├── api/
│   └── chat.js         # Vercel serverless function (optional, for deployment)
├── vercel.json         # Vercel config
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Everything — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — lives in one `index.html` file. No build step, no npm install, no framework.

---

## 🚢 Deploy to Vercel

### With Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### With GitHub (recommended)
1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → **Add New Project**
3. Import your GitHub repo
4. Click **Deploy**

Your app will be live at `https://your-app.vercel.app` in ~30 seconds.

> **Note:** When deployed to Vercel, the AI Tutor uses the `/api/chat` serverless proxy instead of calling Anthropic directly. Add your API key as an environment variable:
> ```
> ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
> ```
> In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
